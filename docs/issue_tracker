1.currently tests are tightly coupled for object creation related tasks, unable to run them independently. Need to decouple those -
SOLUTION: Fixed with default_factory from dataclasses

2. Currently placing orm as as a single module in src folder

3. Building a fake repository in our repository pattern, I can see how its built I am yet to understand its usage.
SOLUTION: check service layer tests and how the fake repository is used in it along with dependency injection to facilitate simple unit testing

4. Currently facing issues in properly starting a Flask Application inside docker container and running tests against it
SOLUTION: found a workaround for it check .scripts/tests.sh file and readME for info
