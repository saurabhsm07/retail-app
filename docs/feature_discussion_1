K.T:
A product is identified by a SKU (stock-keeping unit)
Customers place orders
    - An order is identified by an order reference and comprises multiple order lines , where each line has a SKU and a quantity . For example:
         •  10 units of RED-CHAIR
         •  1 unit of TASTELESS-LAMP
    - order(order_id, order_line_1, order_line_2,..order_line_n)
    - order_line(order_ref_id, SKU, quantity)

The purchasing department orders small batches of stock.
    - A batch of stock has a unique ID called a reference , a SKU , and a quantity
    - batch(batch_id, SKU, quantity)

 TASK: We need to allocate order lines to batches .

CONDITIONS:
    - When we allocate x units of stock to a batch, the available quantity is reduced by x
    - We can’t allocate to a batch if the available quantity is less than the quantity of the order line
    - We can’t allocate the same line twice. For example:
        •  We have a batch of 10 BLUE-VASE, and we allocate an order line for 2 BLUE-VASE.
        •  If we allocate the order line again to the same batch, the batch should still have an available quantity of 8.
    - We should prefer warehouse stock over shipping stock
    - We should prefer batches with shorter ETA among shipping stock

Personal notes:
    - for allocation we will need an allocate method - DONE
    - for deallocating we will need a deallocate method - DONE
    - to maintain history of allocations we will need a set / queue - DONE
    - Assumption: warehouse stock will not have an ETA date, only shipment stock will
    - we will need to host an array of batches ? how do i do that
    -

Findings:
   - order_line is not an entity it is a value object (it does not have a p.k that will differentiate it):
     An order line is uniquely identified by its order ID, SKU, and quantity (part of a single order ; see K.T section);
     if we change one of those values, we now have a new line.
     any object that is identified only by its data and doesn't have a long-lived identity.
     Batch is an entity (has p.k) Order line is a value object (Does not have p.k)
